As Rose searches for her little girl, she begins to learn the history of the strange town and realizes that her daughter is just a pawn in a larger game.",19.734492,/4Zz9cF8S4E7DITosNYh3spybYJb.jpg,2006-04-21,97607453,125,Released,We've been expecting you.,Silent Hill,FALSE,6.3,1401,TRUE,64748,Silent Hill Collection,Horror|Mystery,559|341|342|55914,4,TriStar Pictures|Silent Hill DCP Inc.|Davis-Films|Konami,CA|FR|JP|US,en,http://www.sonypictures.com/homevideo/silenthill/
